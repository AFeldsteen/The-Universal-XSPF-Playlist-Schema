Howdy, 

I have the ultimate XSPF playlist maker for you. It's written in Python and it's very robust. It can be used to make both simple and complex playlists. To use it, just download the .py file, cd into it 
and run python spliff11.py. I'm working on a front end for it. I hope to get that to you soon. I've also included an XSD for XSPF. They don't have one that I can find, there's a RelaxNG file with
a dead link so I figured I would create the rules in XML and share them with anyone who needs them to build applications that need to read XSPF playlists.
